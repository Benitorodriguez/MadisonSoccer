              at the end of the season because we slipped at the last moment and couldn't go to state. This year we not only expect to retain our titles but also to go to State, stay
              focused throughout the tournament to make it to the final and God willing win the tournament, it would be a dream come true to end my high school career as State Champion. I love
              this team and this badge as well as how everyone here is a family and we always support each other. The banter is always great and the team spirit is as well. It has been a fantastic
              experience to be part of this team and I expect to end it on a high note."</p>

              and a different coach. But what I love most about this team is the ability to adapt. We adapt to our situations and setbacks, pushing through as hard
              as we can in order to succeed, no matter the difficulty. If one person falls, the entire team picks him up and continues to push our way to victory. My goal for
