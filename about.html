    <h3> Our History </h3>
    <p> The Madison boys soccer team got its start when our school first opened their doors in 2003. In the 2015/2016
      season Coach Christopher Baker took the reigns of the Mustangs and helped the team throughout three successful years.
      In the 2015/2016 season the Mustangs were led towards the Best of the West Championship by team captain Adam Joyner.
      A year later the mustangs would go on to have a difficult season without any silverware. In the 2017/2018 season
      however, they would bounce back and go on to win a double. The Mustangs won the Distric Championship and
      the Regional Championship. For the 2018/2019 season the Mustangs plan to retain their titles, go on to the
      State Championship and if all the hard work pays off, win it!
