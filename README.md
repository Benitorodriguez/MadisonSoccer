An easy to use website that's accessible to players, parents and fans created by Benito Rodriguez Nunez and Kristina Fortner.

My partner Kristina Fortner, and I, Benito Rodriguez Nunez, created this website for the Madison Academic Soccer Team. The Madison Academic Boy's Soccer Team is our schools soccer team that has been very successful throughout the years. Both of us look to learn more about coding to overcome obstacles that might come up in the future as well as put it to use when needed in our future careers even if
coding isn't directly involved with our job.

Our website was created to give players, parents and fans, access to team information such as a calendar with important dates and game times.

Website features:
The website contains a calendar for everyone to see important dates such as games and team meetings.

There is a news page for results and other news so that fans who couldn't make it to the game know what happened.

There is a gallery for players to go and download their favorite photos.

The roster page is for fans to know who the players in the team are and for the coach to update the roster.

We added a navy to maroon gradient to add a nice touch of color with our school colors.

The buttons that take you to different pages in the website change color when you hover over them so that they would look a bit more interesting and not as plain.

The boxes we have throughout the website are there to make the page more organized and easier to read and understand.
